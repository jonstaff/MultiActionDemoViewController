I have a frequent need for loading an app that does a number of specified actions upon clicking a 
button. To simplify this process for future use, just subclass `MultiActionDemoViewController`
(or instantiate one and add some `Action`s). It will handle all the boilerplate layout of the
buttons for you.

That's really all there is to it.
